# StudentPal: The Academic Burnout Shield 
Built for the 2026 Student Innovation Hackathon

The Problem
Students today are forced to choose between high grades and healthy sleep. Most planners just list tasks; they don't care if you're exhausted. This leads to burnout, stress, and poor mental health.
our Solution
StudentPal is a proactive daily organizer that balances your academic workload with your biological needs. By integrating with school data (via Clever), our AI Agent analyzes your upcoming assignments and your self-reported sleep to create a "human-first" schedule.

Key Features
Clever Integration: One-click sync to pull assignments directly from school portals—no manual typing required.

AI Study Agent: A smart assistant that gives different advice based on your sleep data (e.g., "Take a nap" vs. "Deep work mode").

Burnout Shield: If sleep is low, the app automatically flags high-difficulty tasks for later and prioritizes rest.

Dynamic UI: A dashboard that changes based on the time of day and student energy levels.

Tech Stack

Styling: CSS3
